/**
HELargeCenterTabBarController, a UITabBarController where the middle tab is larger.

Based upon the logic found here: http://idevrecipes.com/2010/12/16/raised-center-tab-bar-button/

Naturally, this assumes an odd number of tabs. Nothing is necessarily done to prohibit or enforce it, but
it will look odd with an even number of tabs.

The center tab is actually a `UIButton` superimposed over the `UITabBar`. Thus the interaction effects (tapping)
isn't exactly like a tab bar button, but as close as we can get. Cosmetics are fully supplied by the
given images -- including any borders, labels, transparency, or other cosmetics. Note that you will want
to play with the height and width of your images to find the ideal size for your app. Consider that
the center `UIButton` is merely superimposed thus the middle tab bar button is actually still in place
and likely will stick out a little bit to either side of your `UIButton`; this means a user can still
tap on the actual tab bar button, thus HELargeCenterTabBarController works to make that interaction
effect seemless and still behave properly. Due to this **HELargeCenterTabBarController must be its own
delegate** -- do *NOT* override that. If we need it that someone external needs to delegateness, then 
we can work that out later (file an enhancement request).

It is expected to provide different images to represent when the center tab is selected vs.
unselected. If for some reason you must use the same image for both states, then you can simply
pass the same `UIImage` for both states.

    Sets the center tab/button to the given parameters.
    
    The center "tab" is really a UIButton, which will be sized to the dimensions of the given unselected image. The exact size of the image is up to you. In choosing a size, consider of course the height should extend slightly above the tab bar (but not too much so as to obscure content), and the width should be wide enough to cover most of the underlying tab bar button, but that some of the tab bar button will be exposed (depending upon device, tab bar width, device orientation, OS version, etc.).
    
    The image provides the whole content -- cosmetics, labels, borders, etc.. Ideally the selected and unselected images should be the same size, content, and general appearance, just that one will look selected (e.g. brighter) and the other will look unselected (e.g. more subdued). This will allow for seemless UI transitions between the two states.
    
    Because the center tab is actually a button, a target/action can be optionally provided so when the center tab is selected it will execute the target/action (as well as selecting the tab).
    
    The `allowSwitch` option provides control over whether taps on the tab/button will actually switch tabs or not. If true (default), taps on the button/tab will switch to make the center ViewController the selected/visible ViewController. If false, taps on the button/tab will not select the center ViewController. This allows the center button/tab to be used exclusively as a button (thus you will want to set the target and action), to give the center tab/button alternative behavior (e.g. perhaps instead of switching tabs, it presents a ViewController modally over the whole screen).
    
    - parameter unselectedImage: UIImage for the center button/tab, unselected state.
    - parameter selectedImage:   UIImage for the center button/tab, selected state.
    - parameter target:          Optional action target to message when tapping the center button/tab.
    - parameter action:          Optional target selector to execute when tapping the center button/tab.
    - parameter allowSwitch:     If true, taps on the center button/tab will select that tab. If false, taps will not select (but target-action will still be executed).
